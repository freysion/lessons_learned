## Things I Have Learned at Bloc.io

I have learned a good number of things at Bloc.io so far. Here are some of the things that I have learned:

**1. HTML**
  * Proper html language and best practices (i.e., use paragraph tags `<p>` instead of the line break tags `<br>` to create margins between paragraphs).
  * Design and code for Accessibility in order to cover all users including those with screen readers.
  * How to create forms, tables, and more in HTML.
  * Every HTML file has a `head` and a `body`!

**2. CSS**
  * CSS helps describe how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen.
  * There are three different versions of CSS styling: inline, internal, and external. External is probably the method of CSS styling I would use the most since it would be just changing one file (that will affect most or the entire website).
  * Use properties and their values to adjust the style of selectors (i.e., tag, ID, class).

**3. CSS Frameworks**
  * There are three top Frameworks: Bootstrap, Foundation, and Material Design.
  * Bootstrap is the most commonly used framework within the community due to longer and continuing development as well as community support.
  * Frameworks are there to help developers develop faster by giving them a starting point of files and folders of standardized code.

**3. Tools of the Trade**
  * We need certain tools to develop:
    * Operating System (i.e., macOS, Windows, Linux)
    * Web Browser (i.e, Chrome)
    * Text editor (i.e., Atom)
    * Terminal

**4. Command Line**
  * Learned how to use commands in the shell prompt in the Terminal to run programs, interact with the OS, write scripts, etc.
  * This is also where Git will be used primarily as well.
  * Learned some basics as to how to adjust the command line environment via nano.

**4. Git**
  * Github is a distributed version control system that is commonly used for commercial development.
  * Git allows developers to see a timeline of their changes and progressions on their development project.
  * Git is primarily interacted with through the Terminal and Github by using Git commands within a Git repository.
  * Learning how to interact with Github using the git commands.


  And there is a bunch more I am still planning on learning!
